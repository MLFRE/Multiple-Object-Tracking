# Multiple-Object-Tracking
Blob detection of multiple objects with object indexing and drawning trajectories.
Plan:
- detect objects (blobs) [DONE] 
- find their positions in the image, [DONE]  
- assume that blobs can touch with each other, [DONE] 
- use linear Kalman filter with Munkres algorithm for indexing detected objects, [DONE]
- use Monte Carlo method for indexing detected objects,
- return indexed trajectories, [DONE]
- allow usage of filters in the web page with means of Dajngo,
- allow user to customize detection method and filters parameters.
